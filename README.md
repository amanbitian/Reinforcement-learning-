# Reinforcement-learning-

## Types of Reinforcement: There are two types of Reinforcement: 
 

### Positive – 
Positive Reinforcement is defined as when an event, occurs due to a particular behavior, increases the strength and the frequency of the behavior. In other words, it has a positive effect on behavior. 

    Advantages of reinforcement learning are: 
        * Maximizes Performance
        * Sustain Change for a long period of time
        * Too much Reinforcement can lead to an overload of states which can diminish the results
 
### Negative – 
    Negative Reinforcement is defined as strengthening of behavior because a negative condition is stopped or avoided. 

    Advantages of reinforcement learning: 
        * Increases Behavior
        * Provide defiance to a minimum standard of performance
        * It Only provides enough to meet up the minimum behavior

`Various Practical applications of Reinforcement Learning –` 
 

    RL can be used in robotics for industrial automation.    
    RL can be used in **machine learning and data processing
    RL can be used to create training systems that provide custom instruction and materials according to the requirement of students.

RL can be used in large environments in the following situations: 
 

1. A model of the environment is known, but an analytic solution is not available;
2. Only a simulation model of the environment is given (the subject of simulation-based optimization)
3. The only way to collect information about the environment is to interact with it.
